# C++ Variables, Literals and Constants
C++ Variables
- ```int age = 14;```
- we can use the ```double``` data type if we have to store decimals and exponentials.
- ```int age = 14;   // age is 14```
- ```age = 17;       // age is 17```

Rules for naming a variable
- Variable names should not begin with an uppercase character.

C++ Literals
- Literals are data used for representing fixed values.
- Here, 1, 2.5 and 'c' are literals. Why? You cannot assign different values to these terms.
- 1. Integers
  - 3 types: decimal (base 10), octal (base 8), hexadecimal (base 16)
  - In C++ programming, octal starts with a 0, and hexadecimal starts with a 0x.
- 2. Floating-point literals
  - ```-2.0```, ```0.0000234```, ```-0.22E-5```
- 3. Characters
- 4. Escape Sequences
  - characters that cannot be typed or has special meaning in C++ programming. For example, newline (enter), tab, question mark, etc.

- 5. String Literals
  - sequence of characters enclosed in double-quote marks

C++ Constants
- we can create variables whose value cannot be changed. For that, we use the const keyword.
